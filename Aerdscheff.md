# Äerdschëff: Luxembourg Earthship

I had the pleasure to have a tour of the Äerdschëff Earthship in Luxembourg on the 27th April 2022. The team is really nice, you can ask to book a tour/visit, in my case Rodrigo made it happens and answered all my questions. There is still some work on going in the Earthship due to Covid and other logistics issues. It will be fully finished in several months, there is a lot of *Love* put in the Earthship and you can see and feel it all around by the quality of the work.

## Overview

This Earthship is kind of special because it makes around 300 square meters, it is 30 meters long and it contains a lot of improvements with respect to the *original* design. Also, it is a *public* building and it has to match several constraints imposed by various rules and laws in Luxembourg. It is a not really a "home" but a place with different purposes: research, design, experiment, traine, educate.


## Modifications/Improvements
For sure this is quiet incomplete, but I think it contains a resume of the key points that are making a huge difference:

- Insulation: the floor, the roof and the walls are insulated (natural materials based on wood for the wall and the roof, hemp based for the floor)
- Light wells in the back of the rooms
- Clay based material covering walls: humidity buffer and additional thermal mass
- Earth based floors in the rooms 
- Heating floor 
- 8 Solar Thermal panels on the south connected to a 1000 liters reservoir for hot-water and connected to the heating floor
- 20 Solar Electric panels on the roof (3 lines)
- Larger corridor and larger volume for the green house, 30 to 40 persons/students can be in the Earthship for lectures and other activities
- Non angled windows: dual glazed windows, non angled windows are smaller, generating less heat losses (Greenhouse is insulated too)
- Triple glazed windows for the rooms, improving insulation from the Greenhouse (+ noise insulation)
- 3 * 10 000 liters cisterns

## Reuse/Recycling
- Windows of the Greenhouse
- Timber/wood: a lot of wood and timber has been reused/recycled
- Greenhouse corridor: the floor is covered with reused kitchen and bathrooms tiles
- Excavated Earth has been reused next to the Earthship to build a BMX Track

## Public building legal constraints
This part is most likely incomplete.
- Structure: large wood beams have been put to support the roof, but for sure the Tire wall is strong enough to support it
- Connected to public water
- External toilets
- External storage for batteries, inverters
- Automatic window opening in case of fire
