# Earthship Notes 
Just a short set of notes about **Earthship**  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthship)

Actually it is an interesting way to build houses having a large amount of windows like a greenhouse to capture solar energy and using large thermal mass (thermal inertia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_mass) acting as a *buffer* (battery) to regulate the temperature all the year around. There is also a major improvement for water management/recycling: rain is captured and filtered, washing water is used for plants inside the house (*gray water*) then reused for pee/poop (*black water*)  which put in a septic tank that can used to feed ornemental plants for instance outside the house.

## Windows
The angle of the windows is quiet important: too hot or too cold. There is the so-called *Solar Declination* during the Winter the angle of the Earth is around -23.4 degrees while during the Spring around 0 degree and in the Summer around 23.4 degrees and Autumn 0 degree again

The idea is to have for the Winter windows perpendicular to the rays so the sun heat up more and during the Summer less heat comes inside the house.

## Materials
The goal is to make it cheap and reuse as much material as possible.
Tires used as a kind of lost mold encapsulated **Rammed earth** as thermal mass (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammed_earth), the earth is manually compressed with a sledge hammer inside each tire.
