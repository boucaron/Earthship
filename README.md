# Earthship Notes 
Just a short set of notes about **Earthship**  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthship)

Actually it is an interesting way to build houses having a large amount of windows like a greenhouse to capture solar energy and using large thermal mass (thermal inertia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_mass) acting as a *buffer* (battery) to regulate the temperature all the year around. There is also a major improvement for water management/recycling: rain is captured and filtered, washing water is used for plants inside the house (*gray water*) then reused for pee/poop (*black water*)  which put in a septic tank that can used to feed ornemental plants for instance outside the house.

## Windows
The sizing and the orientation of the windows is important: too hot or too cold.
On the angle of the windows. There is the so-called *Solar Declination* during the Winter the angle of the Earth is around -23.4 degrees while during the Spring around 0 degree and in the Summer around 23.4 degrees and Autumn 0 degree again

https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/solar-declination
The idea is to have for the Winter windows perpendicular to the rays so the sun heat up more and during the Summer less heat comes inside the house.

- Problem with the angle of the windows, structurally not designed to have such a slopped angle, lot of rain/snow can accumulate on it.
- Problem the green-house is not separated physically separated with the home : humidity can be an issue. Most new designs have inside windows to separate from the green-house.
- Ventilation is required to prevent the green-house to become an oven.
- Light in the room can be an issue, probably light wells are required on the roof to have adequate light in the rooms. It depends on the place it is built.

## Materials
The goal is to make it cheap and reuse as much material as possible.
Tires used as a kind of lost mold encapsulated **Rammed earth** as thermal mass (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammed_earth), the earth is manually compressed with a sledge hammer inside each tire.

Probably using a *pneumatic tamper* tool will speedup the process for the compaction of the material as shown in this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aFrWWON8VE, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaGFrVGMzb4, it is also possible to find a cheaper electric one that can be used on a jack hammer (look for damper, compactor, tamper).
It is also possible to automate the construction of the wall as shown here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TXj5IIkUIY 

## Economics

### Human Labour
This is probably my main concern. The construction of a Earthship using Tires pounding is really huge for a *small* house: 900 to 1000 Tires with let say a lower-bound 20 minutes with 2 persons (one ramming and the other one bringing the dirt - assuming young and strong crew), it is about 360 to 500 hours: it means nearly 90 to 125 Man Days of Tire pounding during 8 hours a day (excluding pauses). This is the part that should be highly automated.

### Reused Materials
It depends on which place you are, in Western Europe there is some recycling performed with different performances. Typically, I will not consider to use any metal from cans due to metal shortage and the recycling industry works correctly for this specific case. It would be down-recycling to put such metal in the walls as fillers, just use small to medium sized rocks locally available.

### Insulation
- Windows needs to be well very insulated and probably having a metal film to reduce heat losses. Orientation, micro-climate of the location and shadows during the day due to trees for instance must be taking care, also the surface of the windows needs to be optimized. Having only windows on a side is a problem. For instance in a Warm Temperature Climate it will make sense to have few windows on the North.
- The walls are mostly a kind of *rammed earth*, while providing Thermal mass it provides little insulation. Especially, the massive volume on the back of the house will act has a massive heat-sink during the winter in cold climates. A double wall with an insulator makes sense in such case, however using Tires prevents to choose the correct *width* for the inside walls providing the adequate Thermal mass while making it easy to heat-up during winter. Same comment for the floor insulation and the roof (on a case by case of course). Article: Design optimization of insulated cavity rammed earth walls for houses in Australia https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778814009396
- No floor insulation, typically use an insulation material able to support compressive load.

### Angled Windows 
- Having angled windows optimized for Winter  means longer windows. Larger windows means: additional cost, additional heat losses. Additional can be issues for the rain, the snow, additional cleanup needed and a lot of additional heat during the summer due to the orientation. Also, if something fall from the roof, the risk of braking the glass.

## Improvements

### Light

- In general there is no window on the Back/North of the Earthship. It is possible to install light wells or tubular skylights on the roof, with additional leakage risks on the roof. You have to be careful on the material used for those, because such items are not really designed with insulation in mind, which is a long term problem. In case of tubular skylights, additional insulation is needed all around the tubes made of metal and additional isolation lens are required.

### Thermal Mass
- It would be interesting to put a *Trombe* wall between the greenhouse and the room with smaller windows on the room side. This wall accumulates most of the heat during the winter and release it, during the summer it reduces the hot area found in the greenhouse to the rooms and the smaller windows of the room reduce the heat loss.
- Similar to the previous point, the floor in the corridor and the rooms can be used as thermal mass too see *Kachadorian* floor which as the same property as the *Trombe* wall but without the light reduction issue. Additional work required to have a good insulation under the floor.


### GeoThermal
- The large sized cisterns can be used to create a natural airconditioning, using a closed-loop system with a polyethelene tubes around the cisterns and one or more heat-exchangers inside the house with a small pump. The heat exchanger can be built from a cheap automotive water cooling radiator and a large fan. It has the advantage of being compact, efficient and very easy to clean.

### Thermal solar panels
- The large front can be used also to put a few thermal solar panels for the purpose of the hot water, but it can also be used *on-demand* during the night or the day if the water tank is well insulated, for instance reusing the previous discussed heat-exchangers.  Most likely it will be more effective on Spring and Fall to reduce the need to heat the Earthship.

### Humidity
- Loam mortar can be used to control the humidity inside the building. Loam mortar is also providing a large thermal mass. It can be used in the green house, the bathroom and of course in the rooms (see. *Minke Gernot - Building with earth design and technology of a sustainable architecture*). Of course it needs protection from direct contact with water, Lime based mortar can be used in such case (Takelakt for the bathroom for instance).
- Loam/Earth based floor in the Greenhouse, same idea Thermal mass and the humidity buffering/regulation.

### Structure
- Design for Earth Quakes, stiffer structure for instance Front/South part may need a structural pier every 4 meters, ring beams, shape of the walls ...etc...


### Shape/Orientation
- The shape of the Earthship may be improved according to the orientation, according to the east or to the west, according to other buildings/trees.
